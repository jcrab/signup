# Sign Up Form

1. Make the following changes to the HTML file:
- format the HTML (so that maintainers can easily read the HTML)
- replace the ??? placeholders with proper arguments
- NOTE: do not make other changes or naming modifications (e.g., do not change the file extension)

2. Based on the changes above, create a PHP page to process the form data
- display each of the input values with proper labels next to each
- for example: Name: Joe Blow
